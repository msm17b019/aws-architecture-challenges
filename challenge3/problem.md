# Task: Implement a Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for a Media Streaming Platform

## Requirements:

- Design a scalable and low-latency architecture for a media streaming platform that serves users globally.
- Implement a CDN to distribute content to users with minimal latency.
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance for uninterrupted streaming experiences.
- Optimize for cost efficiency.

## Components to Include:

- Utilize Amazon S3 for storing media content.
- Implement Amazon CloudFront as the CDN to cache and distribute content globally.
- Use Amazon EC2 or AWS Lambda for server-side processing, such as video transcoding or dynamic content generation.
- Set up a multi-region architecture to enhance availability and reduce latency.
- Implement AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for security against common web exploits.

## Considerations:

- Implement adaptive bitrate streaming for better user experiences across varying network conditions.
- Utilize Amazon Route 53 for DNS to route users to the nearest edge location.
- Implement logging and monitoring to track user engagement and troubleshoot issues.
- Explore options for content protection and encryption.

## Challenges:

- Handle concurrent streaming sessions efficiently.
- Implement a mechanism to scale resources based on demand.
- Optimize the CDN configuration for the best performance.
- Consider strategies for handling regional blackout restrictions or personalized content delivery.
