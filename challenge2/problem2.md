# Task: Build a Serverless Data Processing Pipeline

## Requirements:

- Ingest large volumes of data (e.g., logs, events) from different sources.
- Process and analyze the data using serverless components.
- Store the processed data efficiently for future analysis.
- Ensure scalability and cost-effectiveness.

## Components to Include:

- Utilize Amazon S3 for raw data storage.
- Implement AWS Lambda functions for data ingestion and processing.
- Use Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora Serverless for storing processed data.
- Implement AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Set up event triggers for automatic processing when new data arrives.
- Ensure encryption and access controls for sensitive data.

## Considerations:

- Optimize for parallel processing to handle varying data loads.
- Implement error handling and retries for robustness.
- Utilize AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the data processing workflow.
- Implement monitoring and logging for visibility into the pipeline's performance.

## Challenges:

- Handle schema changes in the incoming data gracefully.
- Implement versioning for the processed data to support backward compatibility.
- Explore ways to optimize costs, especially when dealing with varying data volumes.
