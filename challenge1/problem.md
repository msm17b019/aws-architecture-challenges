# Task: Design a Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Web Application Architecture

## Requirements:

- Your web application should handle a large number of concurrent users.
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance to handle potential failures in different components.
- Implement a cost-effective solution.

## Components to Include:

- Use Amazon EC2 instances for hosting your application.
- Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- Utilize Amazon RDS for database storage with read replicas.
- Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data.
- Set up CloudFront for content delivery and optimization.
- Implement automated scaling policies to handle varying loads.
- Ensure proper security measures, such as VPC, security groups, and IAM roles.

## Considerations:

- Optimize for performance and minimize latency.
- Implement logging and monitoring solutions for proactive issue detection.
- Use AWS services that align with the serverless paradigm where applicable.
- Document the architecture and provide rationale for your design choices.

## Challenges:

- Handle database schema updates with minimal downtime.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan.
- Ensure that the architecture can seamlessly accommodate future feature enhancements.
